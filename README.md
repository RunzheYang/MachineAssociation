Consider we have trained a classifier `C`, for example, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), or a Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify instances from a good dataset `E` provided by "Experts". There is another poor dataset `A` of the same task generated by "Apprentices" or "Adversarial Attackers", on which the classifier `C` performs poorly. The goal of hypothetical refinement is to raise a _what if_ question: _"What if the data looks like this way?"_ and to modify the instance to pass classifier `C` with high confidence by associative inference.
